# Skin-Lesion-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-Approach

-Applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and some transfer learning models like VGG16, EfficientNET, 
-MobileNet, and DenseNet to create a robust system for classifying skin lesions into specific categories.
-Addressed class imbalance and enhanced generalization with data preprocessing and augmentation.
-Used TensorFlow and Flask to build user friendly web application
